# Iterate over the hash above collecting each pigeon by name and insert it
# as the key of a new hash where each name holds the attributes for that bird. 
# Your output should match the hash below:

# pigeon_list = {
#   "Theo" => {
#     :color => ["purple", "grey"],
#     :gender => "male",
#     :lives => "Subway"
#   },
#   "Peter Jr." => {
#     :color => ["purple", "grey"],
#     :gender => "male",
#     :lives => "Library"
#   },
#   "Lucky" => {
#     :color => ["purple"],
#     :gender => "male",
#     :lives => "City Hall"
#   },
#   "Ms .K" => {
#     :color => ["grey", "white"],
